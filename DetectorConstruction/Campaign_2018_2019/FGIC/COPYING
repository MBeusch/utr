 * Description:
 *
 * This program provides the base for building a simulation of the
 * Blowfish neutron detector array.  It defines the geometry and other
 * characteristics of Blowfish and the Blowfish detectors.  It is ment
 * as a template where you can add geometries for experiment-dependent
 * uses.  The 'X' means 'fill in the blank'.
